# Musician/Teacher/Researcher website

# WARNING: Work in progress!

## Done so far:

1. Homepage
2. Performer page
3. Teacher page
4. SEO
5. Researcher page

## To do:

1. Use real content and not lorem ipsum or stock images
2. Convert images to webp to improve loading speed
3. Use lazy loading for images
4. Carousel that dinamically fetches videos and photos uploaded by the musician. Fetching them from either AWS Bucket or cloudnary. Still deciding.

## Tech-stack

1. [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)
2. [Cosmic JS](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) This CMS integrates with Nuxt and enables a non-tech person to modify certain pre-defined sections of the website by themselves
3. [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for the styling
4. [Formspark](https://formspark.io/) for contact form submissions
