# Musician/Teacher/Researcher website

# WARNING: Work in progress!

## Done so far:

1. Homepage
2. Performer page (missing the video and logos of the clients the musician has worked for)
3. Teacher page
4. SEO

## To do:

1. Researcher page like a blog
2. Optimisation by placing the cosmic js core code in a utils file and not directly in the components
3. Use real content and not lorem ipsum or stock images
4. Convert images to webp to improve loading speed
5. Use lazy loading for images

## Tech-stack

1. [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)
2. [Cosmic JS](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) This CMS integrates with Nuxt and enables a non-tech person to modify certain pre-defined sections of the website by themselves
3. [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) for the styling
4. [Formspark](https://formspark.io/) for contact form submissions
